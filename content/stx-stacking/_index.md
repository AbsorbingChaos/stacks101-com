The stacks protocol supports stacking, where users can lock up their STX for a chosen period and in return receive BTC committed by Stacks miners.

[Stacking is not the same as staking](https://stacks.org/stacking#rec260034192) implemented by other networks, and your funds never leave your wallet. There is no risk of losing them.
