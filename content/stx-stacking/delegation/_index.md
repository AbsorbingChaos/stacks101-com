The stacks protocol supports stacking, where users can lock up their STX for a chosen period and in return receive BTC committed by Stacks miners.

[Stacking is not the same as staking](https://stacks.org/stacking#rec260034192) implemented by other networks, and your funds never leave your wallet. There is no risk of losing them.

Read below to see answers to common questions around delegated stacking, or [view the stacking resources](/stx-stacking/resources) for more information.

You can revoke as long as the stx are unlocked and re-delegate with a new amount.

Otherwise you have to use a different address and delegate your remaining unlocked Stacks from there. .

### I transferred Stacks to the delegatee address. What now?

You can ask the pool admin whether they kindly return them. Then you can delegate them.
